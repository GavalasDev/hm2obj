# hm2obj
hm2obj is a command line utility for creating render-ready 3D models from heightmaps generated by remote sensing satellite instruments (e.g. see [AW3D30](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/dataset/aw3d30/aw3d30_e.htm)), developed as part of my thesis.

Features include optimizations for 3D modeling of islands, like the ability to provide a binary mask for slicing the output model and quality of life features like built-in Gaussian blur filtering for model smoothing.

## Setup
First clone the repository using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GavalasDev/hm2obj
cd hm2obj
chmod +x hm2obj.py
```

Then, after optionally creating a new virtual environment, install all dependencies by running:
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The python version used for testing was *3.12.3*.

## Usage

The standard format of an hm2obj command is the following:
```bash
./hm2obj.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-b BLUR] [-d DOWNSAMPLE] [-m MASK] [--minz MINZ]
            [--maxz MAXZ] [--px_per_km PX_PER_KM] filename
```
To see all available options, use:
```bash
./hm2obj.py --help
```
### Example
In `examples/` a sample heightmap image of Santorini, Greece from the [AW3D30](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/dataset/aw3d30/aw3d30_e.htm) dataset, as well as a manually drawn binary mask is provided. By executing:
```bash
./hm2obj.py -d 10 --minz=0 --maxz=567 --px_per_km=260 -m examples/mask.png -o santorini.obj examples/heightmap.png
```
a 3D model of the island in the .obj format named `santorini.obj` is created. In case no output file is provided, the generated obj file is printed to `stdout`.
